implement
  - branching commands
      - label
          - labels the current location in the function's code
      - goto
          - effects an unconditional goto operation, causing execution
            to continue from the location marked by the label
      - if-goto
          - the stack's topmost value is popped; if the value is not
            zero, execution continues from the location marked by the
            label; otherwise, execution continues from the next command
            in the program
  - function commands
      - function
          - initializes the local variables of the callee
          - generates an entry label in assembly
      - call
          - save the frame of the caller on the stack and jumps to
            execute the callee
          - generates an assembly goto instruction
          - create a return address label and pushes it onto the stack
          - inject label into generated code
      - return
          - copies the return value to the top of the caller's working
            stack, reinstates the segment pointers of the caller, and
            jumps to execute the latter from the return address onward
          - pops the return address off the stack and generates a goto
            instruction
  - generate assembly code that sets SP to 256
  - handle multiple .vm files
